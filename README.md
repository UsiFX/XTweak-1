# MODES
## 1) Auto X 
#### Auto X is improved version of the Auto mode based on automatic profile. It will automatically change modes based on user behavior and conditions. For example: While you are gaming, Auto X mode will automatically change mode to potency for better gameplay.
## 2) Accumulator
#### Accumulator is power saver mode. It reduces CPU and GPU speeds and adjusts kernel parameters based on battery profile.
## 3) Potency 
#### Potency gives a speedy function to the system. Maximizes CPU and GPU speeds and adjusts kernel parameters based on gaming profile.
## 4) Equalizer 
#### Equalizer performs equally for performance and battery. Minimize CPU and GPU speeds and adjusts kernel parameters based on balanced profile.
## 5) Output
#### Output is performance enhancer mode. Maximizes CPU and GPU speeds and adjusts kernel parameters based on performance profile.
